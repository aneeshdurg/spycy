# sPyCy

![TCK CI status](https://github.com/aneeshdurg/spycy/actions/workflows/tck.yml/badge.svg)

sPyCy is a python implementation of [openCypher](https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/).
Try it out in your browser here: [https://aneeshdurg.me/spycy](https://aneeshdurg.me/spycy)

The goal of `sPyCy` is to enable using openCypher as a frontend, or to embed
openCypher in other projects. To this end, `sPyCy` is quite modular and several
components such as the underlying graph implementation, the subgraph pattern
matcher, and the expression evaluator can all be substituted with a custom
implementation. See `examples/` for some sample usage, and for some examples where
the graph implementation is satisfied by third-party objects (e.g. HTML DOM, LLVM IR, etc)

The long-term goals of this project include fully passing all openCypher TCK
tests. Currently a majority of TCK tests are expected to pass. The failing tests
are documented.

Some major **unimplemented** features are `MERGE`, temporal values, `WHERE`
predicates involving patterns, existential subqueries, and `CALL`.

## Installation

You can either install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/spycy-aneeshdurg/) or build `sPyCy` yourself. To install the pre-built wheel, run:

```bash
pip install spycy_aneeshdurg
```

To build it yourself, from the root of this repo, run:

```bash
# Optional - create and enter a venv
# python3 -m venv venv
# source ./venv/bin/activate # this command varies from shell to shell
pip install .
```

## Usage:

```bash
# Example usage:
python3 -m spycy --query "CREATE (a {id: 'node0'})-[:X]->(b) return a"

# Or interactive mode:
python3 -m spycy --interactive
> CREATE (a {id: 'node0'})-[:X]->(b {id: 'node1'})
> MATCH (a)--(b) RETURN a.id, b.id
    a.id   b.id
0  node0  node1
```

`sPcY` can also be used via python:
```python
from spycy import spycy
exe = spycy.CypherExecutor()
ids = list(range(100))
exe.exec(f"UNWIND {ids} as x CREATE ({{id: x}})")
num_nodes_gt_10 = exe.exec("MATCH (a) WHERE a.id > 10 RETURN count(a) as output")["output"]
print(f"There are {num_nodes_gt_10} node(s) with an id greater than 10")
```
